call
me
ishmael
some
years
agonever
mind
how
long
precisely
having
little
or
no
money
in
my
purse
and
nothing
particular
to
interest
me
on
shore
i
thought
i
would
sail
about
a
little
and
see
the
watery
part
of
the
world
it
is
a
way
i
have
of
driving
off
the
spleen
and
regulating
the
circulation
whenever
i
find
myself
growing
grim
about
the
mouth
whenever
it
is
a
damp
drizzly
november
in
my
soul
whenever
i
find
myself
involuntarily
pausing
before
coffin
warehouses
and
bringing
up
the
rear
of
every
funeral
i
meet
and
especially
whenever
my
hypos
get
such
an
upper
hand
of
methat
it
requires
a
strong
moral
principle
to
prevent
me
fromde
liberately
stepping
into
the
street
and
methodically
knocking
peoples
hats
offthen
i
account
it
high
time
to
get
to
seaas
soon
as
i
can
this
is
my
substitute
for
pistol
and
ball
with
a
philosophical
flourish
cato
throws
himself
upon
his
swordi
quietly
take
to
the
ship
there
is
nothing
surprising
in
this
if
they
but
knew
it
almost
all
men
in
their
degree
some
timeor
other
cherish
very
nearly
the
same
feelings
towards
the
ocean
with
me
there
now
is
your
insular
city
of
the
man
hattoes
belted
round
by
where
as
indian
isles
by
coral
reefs
commerce
surrounds
it
with
her
surfright
and
left
the
streets
take
you
water
ward
its
extreme
downtownis
the
battery
where
that
noble
mole
is
washed
by
waves
and
cooled
by
breezes
which
a
few
hours
previous
were
out
of
sight
of
land
look
at
the
crowds
of
water
gazers
there
